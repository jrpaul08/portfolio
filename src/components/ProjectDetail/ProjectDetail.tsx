              Performed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis of retail customer data to uncover actionable customer segments. Through segmentation based on purchasing behavior, RFM analysis enables data-driven marketing decisions; supporting personalized outreach, improved retention of valuable customers, early identification of churn risks, and optimized allocation of marketing efforts to increase profitability. Built an interactive dashboard to present findings and cluster-level KPIs for business stakeholders.

              <li>The RFM clustering analysis identified 7 distinct customer segments, revealing a Pareto pattern where roughly 25% of customers drive most of the revenue. High-value segments (Delight, Pamper, Upsell) represent this top tier, while the remaining 75% fall into lower-value groups (Nurture, Retain, Re-Engage) requiring targeted engagement.</li>
              <li>Notably, the Nurture segment accounts for around 35% of the total customer base, consisting largely of new or inactive customers. This presents a major growth opportunity by investing in onboarding campaigns, personalized recommendations, and targeted offers, businesses can convert these customers into loyal, higher-value buyers.</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, Delight and Pamper customers (high-spend and loyal segments) should be prioritized for retention programs and exclusive loyalty rewards, while Upsell customers benefit most from cross-sell and bundle promotions to increase purchase value.</li>
